# Exploration-of-LangChain-Fine-Tuning-Generative-AI-Models

This repository provides an in-depth implementation of **LangChain**, covering its core components and applications. Key features such as the **Multi-Agent Framework** and **AI Automation** have been implemented to showcase how LangChain can streamline complex tasks and workflows in generative AI.

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement LangChain for real-time applications in **Generative AI**, with a focus on automation, task chaining, and agent-based frameworks. The **Multi-Agent Framework** and **AI Automation** examples highlight LangChain’s versatility in executing multiple tasks efficiently by utilizing its various components.

## Implementation
- **How LangChain Works**: Step-by-step explanation of LangChain's components and functionalities.
- **Core Components**: Detailed breakdown of core components such as LLMs, Prompts, Chains, Agents, Memory, Retrieval, and Indexing.
- **Applications**: Implementations include the **Multi-Agent Framework** and **AI Automation**, showcasing how LangChain can be used to automate and optimize workflows.
- **RAG and Fine-Tuning**: A brief comparison and insights into **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Fine-Tuning** are included in the documentation for further exploration.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need:
- Python 
- LangChain (latest version)
- Colab or Jupyter Notebook
- LLaMA3 models or equivalent
- Groq API (for LLaMA model integration)
  
Ensure that all necessary Python libraries are installed before running the code.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide an easily understandable implementation of **LangChain** for educational and practical use in **generative AI** applications. Whether you’re looking to automate tasks using agents or explore complex multi-task workflows, this project provides a solid foundation.
